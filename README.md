# AI Art Collective: Where Machines Meet Muse - An AI Generated Astro Site

This Astro site was generated by an AI assistant for AstroHost.

## Theme & Objective
Discover unique, hand-crafted digital art created by AI. Explore galleries, learn about the process, and support emerging AI artists.
User Prompt: Create a visually stunning website called 'AI Art Collective' that showcases art generated by artificial intelligence. Target audience is art enthusiasts, tech lovers, and collectors. The site should have a clean, modern design with a focus on large, high-quality images. Key sections include: 'Galleries' (organized by AI artist/algorithm), 'About' (explaining the process and the collective's mission), 'Blog' (articles on AI art trends and techniques), and a 'Shop' (for purchasing prints and digital art). Implement a user-friendly filtering system to browse art by style, color palette, and subject matter. Add subtle animations and transitions to enhance the browsing experience. Ensure the site is responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

## Setup & Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or yarn install, or pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser at `http://localhost:4321` (or the port Astro assigns).

3.  **Build for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The static files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to Cloudflare Pages or other static hosts.

## Images
The articles currently use placeholder images from `https://placehold.co`. You should replace these with actual images relevant to your content.
The frontmatter of each article in `src/content/blog/` contains an `image` field with a `dataAiHint` attribute:
```yaml
image:
  url: 'https://placehold.co/800x400.png' # Update this to /images/your-image.jpg after placing it in public/images
  alt: 'Descriptive alt text for your image'   # Update this
  dataAiHint: 'relevant keywords' # This hint describes the intended image. Use it to find or generate a replacement.
```
Place your actual images in the `public/images/` directory and update the `url` in the frontmatter to be like `/images/your-image.jpg`.

## Cloudflare Pages Compatibility
This site is configured for static output by default (`output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs`), making it ready for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.
If SSR with Cloudflare was explicitly requested and the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter is included in `astro.config.mjs` and `package.json`, follow Cloudflare's instructions for deploying Astro SSR sites.

## Customization
- Explore `src/pages/` for page structure.
- Modify layouts in `src/layouts/`.
- Add or edit components in `src/components/`.
- Blog posts are in `src/content/blog/` (MDX or Markdown).
- Site configuration is in `astro.config.mjs`.
- Dependencies are in `package.json`.
- Tailwind CSS configuration is in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- Global styles (if any beyond Tailwind) could be added in `src/styles/global.css` and imported in `BaseLayout.astro`.

Happy coding with your AI-generated Astro site!
